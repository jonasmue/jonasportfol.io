For the [2017 International Genetically Engineered Machine Competition (iGEM)](http://2017.igem.org/Main_Page) we developed 
a Social Augmented Reality Serious game called Pathomon. The game adapts the mechanics of the 2016 blockbuster *Pokémon GO*. 
But instead of fighting cute little monsters, you dive in the role of a young scientist researching in the field of diseases. 
It is your goal to fight viruses until all diseases are erased!

### Augmented Reality
Viruses are everywhere in our environment. Therefore we figured, that they should be displayed exactly there, in the environment. 
More precisely, scanning a QR code of the game will display an animated 3D model of a virus on your smartphone screen. 
You can destroy it by crafting and using antidotes on it.

### Social
There are several social aspects implemented in the game: For starters, there are some highly resistant viruses. You 
have to team up with other players to fight these. Moreover, all players work together towards the common goal of 
eradicating all viruses which is tracked via a metric called "global quota". The more viruses destroyed, the higher the 
global quota! Finally, you are a researcher specialized on a certain disease. After you have fought a virus, it may 
happen that you lose a sample of "your" personal virus. The next player will first have to clean up before they can 
interact with the object usually placed on this code.

### Serious
In contrast to Pokémon GO, our game has a serious background: education on contagious diseases is key to preventing them 
from spreading. For example it was shown that education programs on HIV had a positive impact on reducing transmission 
rates both in developing and developed countries^[Kirby, D., Laris, B. A., & Rolleri, L. (2005). Impact of sex and HIV education programs on sexual behaviors of youth in developing and developed countries. North Carolina: Family Health International, YouthNet Program.]. 
Pathomon conveys general information on disease transmission as well as individual information on certain viruses in a 
playful manner to a target audience ranging from children to adults.

The game was published both for Android and iOS and built on the [Unity Engine](https://www.unity3d.com). More information 
on Pathomon can be found on our [team's website](http://2017.igem.org/Team:Franconia/Project/Pathomon).
