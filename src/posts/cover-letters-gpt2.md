---

I guess nobody really loves writing cover letters ‚Äî so why not have an A.I. do it for you?  I figured it would be a fun 
experiment to try if that actually worked. Research in neural text generation has made big progress in the past two years. Especially OpenAI managed to impress with their GPT releases. However, since they have not released the parameters of their most recent GPT-3^[Brown, T. B., Mann, B., Ryder, N., Subbiah, M., Kaplan, J., Dhariwal, P., ... & Agarwal, S. (2020). Language models are few-shot learners. arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.14165.] 
model yet (and it would presumably not be possible to fine tune this huge model on a Google Colaboratory instance anyway), I decided to fine tune 
an instance of last year's GPT-2^[Radford, A., Wu, J., Child, R., Luan, D., Amodei, D., & Sutskever, I. (2019). Language models are unsupervised multitask learners. OpenAI Blog, 1(8), 9.] 
model.

At the time of its publication, GPT-2 became popular for its superior performance in text generation, being able to write 
articles with coherency spanning across different paragraphs. Some artificially generated text examples can be found on 
[OpenAI's website](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/#sample1). These examples suggest that this model should 
be able to also generate cover letters which range in a similar text length.

## üóû Data
In order tailor the model to a certain domain ‚Äî as in our case the "cover letter domain" ‚Äî one needs a sufficiently 
large dataset to fine tune the model's parameters on. Luckily, there are a lot of example cover letters for all kinds of 
jobs in the internet. The dataset I created consists of 1866 cover letters for the training set and another 208 letters 
for the evaluation set. The data corpus was mainly obtained from [indeed's Cover Letter Samples](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/cover-letter-samples) 
as well as [JobHero's Sample Cover Letters](https://www.jobhero.com/sample-cover-letters/).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Training
Training was conducted on a [Google Colab GPU instance](http://colab.research.google.com) using [Hugging Face's Transformers 
framework](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/language-modeling). As base model, a distilled 
version of GPT-2, [distilgpt2](https://huggingface.co/distilgpt2) was used which was created by the same methods as 
DistilBERT^[Sanh, V., Debut, L., Chaumond, J., & Wolf, T. (2019). DistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT: smaller, faster, cheaper and lighter. arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.01108.]. 
In order to fit on the GPU memory, training was conducted with a block size of 256 which should still generate decent results 
considering that the average cover letter token length is only slightly above this at 278.33.  

## üì® Results

Now, that we have trained the model, let us jump into some of the results. The following collection indicates that the 
fine-tuned model is capable of generating cover letters for a wide variety of job fields. While the letters are certainly not 
perfect, as they sometimes suffer from semantic inconsistencies or word repetition, we can nevertheless see, 
that the model has for sure learned important aspects of writing cover letters. 

The cover letters are structured in a typical way: they start with an introduction, before the main part emphasizes on previous experience or achievements. Finally, the texts 
end with a concluding sentence and a salutation. Interestingly, the model often combines the applicant's names from names seen in the 
training data but sometimes also comes up with its very own names. 

Moreover, the model manages to keep consistency along the course 
of the individual letters as it succeeds to refer coherently and frequently to the human-written prompts.

üí° **Try the model generating your own cover letter [here!](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HpWs27xJkPvFIZ8PLYRxL8i4FyrTtVye?usp=sharing)**

### Examples 

Please note, that the human-written system prompt at the beginning of each cover letter is written in italic typeface, the remainder of the text is then augmented 
by the neural text generation model. Please also note that bullet points in the texts were added manually to increase readability.

### üë©üèæ‚Äçüé® Visual Artist

<div class="text-card-content collapsible-content">

<div style="font-style: italic">

Dear Mr Li, 

Online I read you were looking for a visual artist in your studio. 

</div>

While at my local university, I was a part of a student-based art group called the Student Art Project, which developed a range of visual arts resources and projects. As a part of that, I helped create a painting for the Student Art Project's Facebook page that included a selection of paintings from around the world.

As a student at Coral Springs University, I taught art lessons to fellow students at The Student Art Project. Some of those lessons were very popular and made me feel good about myself. At the end of class, I received a job offer from the school, and I went back to school to work on my painting skills.

I am enthusiastic about my career and love for art as much as anyone in the world. I am thrilled about the possibility to be able to take my passion for art to the next level. My dream is to create a new kind of art that will make the world a better place. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

Nancy D. Housley

### Inspecting Model Bias

As we know from literature, Language Models and Word Embeddings often incorporate stereotypical bias such as gender bias 
based on the training data^[Brunet, M. E., Alkalay-Houlihan, C., Anderson, A., & Zemel, R. (2019, May). Understanding the origins of bias in word embeddings. In International Conference on Machine Learning (pp. 803-811).]. 
Particularly in the domain of occupations such bias has been shown^[Bolukbasi, T., Chang, K. W., Zou, J. Y., Saligrama, V., & Kalai, A. T. (2016). Man is to computer programmer as woman is to homemaker? debiasing word embeddings. In Advances in neural information processing systems (pp. 4349-4357).]. 
For example, an A.I. recruiting tool by Amazon was sharply criticized for discriminating women^[Kodiyan, A. A. (2019). An overview of ethical issues in using AI systems in hiring with a case study of Amazon‚Äôs AI based hiring tool.] 
and was scrapped soon after.

Thus, operating on the same domain, I wanted to investigate whether the model showcased here encapsulated bias as well. In other words, 
would the model return a stereotypical cover letter based on the prompt given to it? The following examples may give a qualitative insight to 
this question but they should not be understood as a complete quantitative study.


<div class="text-card">

**_Dear Sir or Madam, as a <span class="text-highlight">white male</span> ..._**

... with strong qualifications in <span class="text-highlight">health care, nursing, social work, and general medical care</span>, I am well prepared to dedicate myself to the highest standards of care at your facility \[...]

... in the business sector with <span class="text-highlight">eight years of experience in the automotive industry</span>, I am well prepared to serve your company in this capacity. \[...]

... with a bachelor's degree in <span class="text-highlight">accounting, I have been fascinated by the role of accountant in a large part of the American economy</span> and think that it would be a good fit for me to come to the University of Hawaii \[...]

</div>

There does not appear to be much stereotypical bias present in the examples shown above. In the first example, the model 
generated a cover letter for a person with experience in nursing and social work, two fields which previous research 
found to be biased more towards female roles. The text is about a person experienced in the automotive 
industry ‚Äì a sector that has typically been dominated by white men. However, the remaining examples do not follow this trend.

<div class="text-card">

**_Dear Sir or Madam, as a <span class="text-highlight">white female</span> ..._**

... of <span class="text-highlight">Hispanic descent</span>, I feel compelled to present the enclosed resume. As an experienced and motivated professional with a background in <span class="text-highlight">educating and motivating young girls</span>, I am well prepared to dedicate myself to the highest standards of education at your school and exceed your expectations for this role. \[...] Throughout my tenure as an English teacher with St. Helena Middle School, I helped <span class="text-highlight">girls understand their emotions and their needs by connecting with them in a direct, emotionally-sensitive manner</span>.

... with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in <span class="text-highlight">medical statistics</span> and a bachelor‚Äôs degree in <span class="text-highlight">communication and management</span> from Washington University, I am prepared to excel in this role and to substantially benefit your organization. \[...]

... with a bachelor‚Äôs degree in <span class="text-highlight">history</span> from Georgetown University, I am honored to apply for the position of <span class="text-highlight">History Professor</span> \[...]

</div>

These examples paint a slightly different picture. Especially in the first example, the model seems to have been pushed 
into a certain direction by the prompt. Over the whole course of the cover letter, the overarching theme of girls and 
stereotypical characteristics of girls is being picked up. For the remaining examples, this trend is not as strong, yet 
there are still some indications that the training data may have been biased judging from the generated occupational fields 
such as non-profit organizations or nursing. 

<div class="text-card">

... I'm looking forward to the opportunity to make a valuable contribution to your company. My background spans 11 years of experience as a <span class="text-highlight">data entry clerk with Data Entry Service for Crossover Software</span>. \[...]

</div>

For this prompt, there are examples that do not generate stereotypical cover letters, such as the last one. However, 
a considerable amount of generated letters appears to be biased: for instance, the skin tone is picked up by examples two and three. 
Additionally, the third example associates the prompt with substance abuse problems ‚Äì an alarming indicator towards bias 
hidden in the training data. Thus, I ran some more experiments with this prompt, for every ten or so examples around one 
was associated with drug abuse or domestic violence.

<div class="text-card">

**_Dear Sir or Madam, as a <span class="text-highlight">black female</span> ..._**

</div>

Here, interestingly, stereotypical texts do not appear to occur frequently. 
As the examples above indicate, there is almost no reference to the prompt, and they appear to be rather unbiased.

### Fun Experiments

Cover letters are typically written in a very persuasive and colorful way inflating the applicant's experience and skill set. 
Therefore, I wanted to find out how the model turns nonsensical or inappropriate prompts into the style of a cover letter.

I believe that in order to become a customer service representative you have to be open to doing the work for the company.

I would love to be able to help other companies in order to help the company grow and prosper. It would be a fun work and I feel a great sense of responsibility to do the work and help others out. Thank you very much for considering me for the position of Customer Service Representative at Foundry Market Solutions, and I look forward to hearing from you.
