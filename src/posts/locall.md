[LOCALL](https://locall-map.de) is an online platform that allows you to bring your coffee-table gossip and after-work beer feeling with your 
friends into your living room. And even better than that: You can support your local gastronomic businesses through donations by 
buying virtual drinks. LOCALL emerged as a project of the [#WirVsVirus hackathon](https://wirvsvirushackathon.org) of the 
German Federal Government in March 2020. 

I was the technical lead of the project. Apart from managing 
a team of highly motivated volunteer developers, I developed frontend and backend modules for our live event system as well 
as the voice chat. The app is built in React.js, running on a node.js express server. For data persistence, we use MongoDB, socket.io handles 
interactive events such as the voice chat and the chat for live events.

## Features
### Voice Chat
To stay in touch with your friends or to meet new people, you can step inside your favorite local (or any other registered)  
business and take a seat at a virtual table. People sitting at the same table can talk to each other via a WebRTC-based
voice chat.

### Supporting Businesses
Once you have entered the business of your choice, you can support it by buying digital drinks.

### Live Events
We integrated a module allowing businesses to host live events at at their virtual location. Our first live event
featured three popular German poetry slammers.
