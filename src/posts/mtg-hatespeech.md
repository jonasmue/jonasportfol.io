In the light of the *Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz* ([Network Enforcement Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz))
we held a panel discussion about whether website owners should be forced to remove defamatory statements from their platforms. 
The discussion was part of the seminar *Human - Technology - Society* and I was one of the discussants against enforcing deletion.

### What Is Hate Speech?

Before diving into the arguments, let's clarify some concepts first. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech) 
defines hate speech as *"speech that attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as race, religion, ethnic 
origin, national origin, sex, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity"*.

Hate speech is prohibited by law in Germany, the statuatory offenses are called *Beleidigung* (Insult) which can be 
punished with a prison term of up to two years, *Volksverhetzung* (Demagoguery) calling for up to five years in prison 
or *Öffentliche Aufforderung zur Straftat* (Public Incitement to a Criminal Act) which can in the worst case be sentenced 
to unlimited jail time as the instigator is punished like the perpetrator. However, the treatment of hate speech varies 
strongly among different countries: the American law is, for instance, somewhat more liberal as many statements are covered 
by freedom of speech as long as they do not immediately represent an incitement to criminal actions.

Defamation on the other hand *"is the communication of a false statement that, depending on the law of the country, 
harms the reputation of an individual, business, product, group, government, religion, or nation"* ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation)). 
Defamation also states a criminal act in many countries, as for example in Germany it can be punished with up to two years in jail.

### Why Enforce Deletion?

So much for the barren definitions, which however make it seem obvious why website owners should be obligated to remove 
such content: advocates of the Network Enforcement Act argue that the amount hatred and defamation posted online has 
dramatically risen recently, especially on social networks like Facebook or Twitter. To put a number on it, a [statistic (German)](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/bundesamt-fuer-justiz-auslaenderfeindliche-hetze-im-internet-nimmt-dramatisch-zu-1.3268733) 
of the German Federal Agency of Justice amounted the increase of investigation procedures concerning demagoguery via 
internet between 2014 and 2015 to 353,3 %.

Comments offend either individuals or whole groups and are inacceptable not only from a legal but also from a humanist 
standpoint. The effects of such utterances can range from depression and suicidal actions in individuals to brutal violence 
among different groups. It is furthermore argued that the anonymity on the web operates as catalyst as it lowers the 
inhibition threshold and makes haters feel more secure. To put a halt on the rising numbers of hate comments as well 
as the accompanying negative effects on individuals and society in general, many speak out in favor of removing such content.

### Why Do People Post Hate-loaded Comments?

But before jumping to conclusions, it might be interesting to examine why people even express themselves in such hateful 
and discriminatory ways. Certainly, many of the utterances can be attributed to the waves of refugees having entered the 
European Union especially since 2015. Hate is fueled by a diffuse feeling of threat growing inside of a few people and 
evolving out of irrational prejudice as psychologist Dorothee Schulz of the Humboldt University Berlin points out in an 
[interview (German)](https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/psychologie-hinter-hasskommentaren-ignorieren-hilft-nicht.1148.de.html?dram:article_id=389897). 
These people are afraid of being left out and getting a raw deal: statements like "The refugees take all our money and 
live off the welfare state" have sadly become daily business.

As pointed out by contact hypothesis, such prejudice grows stronger the less contact people have to members of unfamiliar 
groups^[Allport, G. W., Clark, K., & Pettigrew, T. (1954). The nature of prejudice.]. Brain scans of test persons showed, 
that alien groups of people – so-called "outgroups"^[Tafjel, H., & Turner, J. C. (1986). The social identity theory of intergroup behavior. Psychology of intergroup relations, 7-24.] 
– are perceived as less human, thus evoking less empathetic feelings^[Gutsell, J. N., & Inzlicht, M. (2010). Empathy constrained: Prejudice predicts reduced mental simulation of actions during observation of outgroups. Journal of experimental social psychology, 46(5), 841-845.]. 
This might be an explaining factor why the amount of [racist comments](https://www.dw.com/en/opinion-to-understand-saxony-look-at-its-history/a-45312184) 
issued from parts of Germany, like Saxony, where only few migrants live is proportionally way higher than for example from Berlin.

### Why Not Enforce Deletion?

Now, that we have pointed out some of the reasons why people post hate and defamation on the internet, let us dive 
into why it might actually not be the best idea to just remove such content. First, let us pick up the argument that 
people hide behind the anonymity of the internet. Actually, this does not quite turn out to be true. A study by researchers 
of the University of Zürich showed, that the most hateful comments were actually posted by users using their real 
name^[Rost, K., Stahel, L., & Frey, B. S. (2016). Digital social norm enforcement: Online firestorms in social media. PLoS one, 11(6), e0155923.]. 
This might be surprising, but the authors figure that the lowered threshold of inhibition on the net is not attributable 
to anonymity, but rather the fact, that the respective counterpart is perceived not so much as human. In line with this 
research, it should be mentioned that South Korea enacted a [Real Name Verification Law](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/24/world/asia/south-korean-court-overturns-online-name-verification-law.html) 
in 2007, only to abolish it again in 2012 due to a lack of success.

Furthermore, deducing from the psychological reasons stated in the previous section, comments filled with hate only 
constitute the symptom of a societal development, but not the root cause. Take an illness as analogy: You do not want 
to block the symptoms, but rather take away the cause. But by simply removing hate speech, the hate might be diverted to 
other channels. Or worse, as Schulz assumes: hate could increase as people do not feel taken seriously when their content 
is removed. As a consequence, these persons might not only use the internet to wreak their opinions but also reality. 
What that looks like, has been observable as many refugee shelters have been [under attack (German)](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flüchtlingsfeindliche_Angriffe_in_der_Bundesrepublik_Deutschland) 
over the last few years.

Many proponents of the Network Enforcement Act might also miss out on another important threat: freedom of speech might 
be restrained. The operators of websites might rather delete too many than too few comments to escape the horrendous 
penalties of up to 40 million Euro they might be faced with upon failing to remove illegal comments within 24 hours. 
However, many comments represent a legal twilight zone and might be covered by freedom of speech, press or arts. Worse 
in that context: sites like Facebook get empowered to decide what is legal and what is not. Many experts criticize this 
form of privatizing the law, as for example Markus Beckedahl, founder of netzpolitik.org [states (translated)](https://netzpolitik.org/2017/netzdg-fake-law-gegen-hate-speech/): 
*"It grants a constitutional power to those that were actually supposed to be limited."* The civil rights organization European Digital Rights 
[adds (translated)](https://www.zeit.de/digital/internet/2017-06/hasskommentare-netzdg-bundestag-gesetz-verabschiedet): 
*"profit-driven businesses get equipped with executive, legislative and judiciary authority on the internet."* 
They argue instead, that those in charge should actually handle illegal content on the net: state-run authorities and courts. 
Therefore, several German organizations and persons signed the so called [Declaration on Freedom of Expression](https://deklaration-fuer-meinungsfreiheit.de/en/).

Finally, an example from [Hungary (German)](https://www.wired.de/collection/life/hatespeech-hassrede-counterspeech-gegenrede-susan-benesch-hass-social-media-facebook) 
shows how anti hate speech laws can be instrumentalized as a political weapon: authorities use such a law to accuse 
the minority group of Roma people of anti-Hungarian propaganda. Hence, ironically the law is utilized against precisely 
those it should in fact protect.

### What Can Be Done Instead?

An effective measure against hate on the web appears to be the principle of [counterspeech](https://dangerousspeech.org/counterspeech/) 
as proposed by Susan Benesh of Harvard University. Her research shows: punishment and deletion do not work in the context of hate speech. 
Quite to the contrary: they reinforce hate. Counterspeech on the other hand means that the person uttering such comments should be answered. 
An effective approach is for example undermining the commenter's authority with humor or irony. Also, constructive criticism or 
stating bare facts is of high value. It is moreover important that counterspeech is applied again and again. Even 
though some people might never be converted, applying this strategy comes with yet another effect: silent readers are called for. 
Positive examples of using counterspeech have already been documented: Applying it in the course of the 2013 Kenyan 
presidential election, a dramatic decline of violence could be measured in comparison with the previous election^[Benesch, S. (2014). Countering dangerous speech to prevent mass violence during Kenya’s 2013 elections. Final Report, 1-26.].

Other positive courses of action include for instance project [HoaxMap (German)](https://hoaxmap.org) which actively fights 
Fake News or the [approach (German)](https://www.amadeu-antonio-stiftung.de/stellungnahme_netzdg) of the Amadeu Antonio 
Stiftung demanding more education on the media and help for the victims of online violence. These positive examples show, 
that using active counterspeech, improved information and media competencies – especially among young people – and 
better support for the victims of hate crime might be promising outlooks in the challenging fight against hate on the internet.
