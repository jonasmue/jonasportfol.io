A gesture classifier for control of an image view application. The system was developed for the HCI master module *Machine Learning*.

User posture and movement are recorded with a Kinect V2. Standard deep feedforward neural networks^[Rosenblatt, F. (1958). The perceptron: a probabilistic model for information storage and organization in the brain. Psychological review, 65(6), 386.] are used for classifying and predicting gestures. 
The software is built on the [Simulator X Engine](https://www.hci.uni-wuerzburg.de/projects/simulator-x/). The following video showcases the results of our work.
