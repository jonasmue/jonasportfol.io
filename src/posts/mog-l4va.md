In the seminar *Multiplayer Online Games* we implemented the multiplayer game **L4VA** for the browser built on the 
[Phaser Engine](http://phaser.io). It is a fast and energetic, lightweight and action packed time killer. 
The player controls a square on a sand platform which is surrounded by lava. The objective is to stay on the platform and push other players onto the lava which makes them lose health points. 
Pushing others over the edge can be achieved with a shockwave mechanism, but there are different types – which one will you choose?

The features of the game furthermore include an account management, the possibility to communicate via chat and emotes, 
a global leaderboard and a list of friends. A first pilot study *n = 4* conducted with the Core Elements of Game Experience Questionnaire (CEGEQ) ^[Calvillo-Gámez, E. H., Cairns, P., & Cox, A. L. (2010). Assessing the core elements of the gaming experience. In Evaluating user experience in games (pp. 47-71). Springer London.] yielded very promising results, but is not representative or statistically valid 
due to the small number of participants and other confounding factors. Nevertheless, it indicated that the participants 
felt very high **Enjoyment**, **Controllability**, and had a great feeling of overall **Gameplay** while **Frustration** remained very low.
