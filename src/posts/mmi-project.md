Multimodal object manipulation system reminiscing the famous classic 
[work of Richard A. Bolt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyBEUyEtxQo)^[“Put-that-there”: Voice and gesture at the graphics interface (Vol. 14, No. 3, pp. 262-270). ACM.] 
Users can create, manipulate and remove basic geometric objects using voice and gesture commands. 
The system was developed for the HCI master module *Multimodal Interfaces*.

Gestures and speech input are recorded with a Kinect V2. An augmented transition network (ATN)^[Woods, W. A. (1970). Transition network grammars for natural language analysis. Communications of the ACM, 13(10), 591-606.] is used for parsing user 
input. The software is built on the [Simulator X Engine](https://www.hci.uni-wuerzburg.de/projects/simulator-x/). The 
following video showcases the results of our work.
