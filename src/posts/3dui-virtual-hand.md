Virtual Reality object manipulation system. Users can create, manipulate and remove basic geometric objects. 
Objects can be grouped into compounds and manipulated as groups. Furthermore, materials can be applied to groups or individual objects. 
The user can move through the environment via teleporting or steering. The system was developed for the HCI master 
module *3D User Interfaces*.

An Oculus Rift 2 and the Oculus Touch Controllers were used as hardware. The software is built on the [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com). 
The following video showcases the results of our work.
