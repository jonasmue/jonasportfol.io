My master's thesis was concerned with improving the quality of a voice assistant for the Technical Service domain using 
word vector models. In particular, I compared domain-specific intrinsic and extrinsic performances of Word2Vec^[Mikolov, T., Chen, K., Corrado, G., & Dean, J. (2013). Efficient estimation of word representations in vector space. arXiv preprint arXiv:1301.3781.], 
GloVe^[Pennington, J., Socher, R., & Manning, C. (2014, October). Glove: Global vectors for word representation. In Proceedings of the 2014 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing (EMNLP) (pp. 1532-1543).], 
FastText^[Bojanowski, P., Grave, E., Joulin, A., & Mikolov, T. (2017). Enriching word vectors with subword information. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 5, 135-146.],

and BERT^[Devlin, J., Chang, M. W., Lee, K., & Toutanova, K. (2019, June). BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding.

### Abstract

Voice assistants in the Technical Service domain can support technicians with predominantly manual maintenance or repair 
tasks via an audio-verbal channel. Traditional assistants often parse user input by matching it against a set of pre-defined patterns. 
However, this technique is not capable of dealing with syntactic variation in the input request. This thesis evaluates 
the applicability of state-of-the-art language representation models in the Technical Service domain. Such models map 
words or word sequences onto multi-dimensional vector embeddings enabling an automatic analysis of syntactic and semantic 
similarity relationships. Five different models, Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText, ELMo, and BERT, are evaluated on three different 
evaluation tasks: an intrinsic evaluation task measures the correlation between model-generated and human-annotated word-word 
similarity scores. Two extrinsic evaluations assess how well the models can classify natural user input questions. The 
results indicate that self-trained and fine-tuned model instances, in general, perform better than pre-trained ones. 
ELMo achieved the best performance among all fine-tuned models, FastText was the best self-trained instance, and GloVe 
represented the best pre-trained model. Furthermore, a prototypical implementation incorporating high-performing models 
is described and its advantages are outlined based on a case study. The prototype also includes a self-learning mechanism 
capable of dynamically adapting to user feedback. Further work is required and discussed to productively use the models 
in a real-world context.

### Demo Prototype
The thesis was presented at the [2019 Human Computer Games & Informatics EXPO](https://games.uni-wuerzburg.de/expo/2019/). 
The presentation featured a prototypical implementation of the enhanced voice assistant. For demonstration purposes, 
visitors  were able to ask the assistant about different properties of a bike such as its wheel size, weight or tire pressure. 
The presentation received the Best Presentation Award.
