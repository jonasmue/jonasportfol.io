Together with the social startup [Flink](http://www.flink-begleitet.de), we developed a platform-independent smartphone 
application bringing together volunteers and social organizations. The main objective was to give potential volunteers 
a seamless access to social work in their surrounding area.

In an iterative design process, we created several forms prototypes beginning with paper prototypes gradually moving to 
HTML mockups and finally ending with a high-fidelity prototype built on the [Ionic Framework](https://ionicframework.com). 
Each of the prototypes was tested with test persons. The final concept was evaluated with a diary study collecting user 
feedback over a time period of roughly one week.
